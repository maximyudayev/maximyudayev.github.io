Hi! I'm Maxim, a late-stage PhD in the team of [Prof. Bart Vanrumste](https://be.linkedin.com/in/bart-vanrumste-1071744) at the [e-Media Research Lab](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/emedia/) of KU Leuven in Belgium, and affiliated with the [Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing, and Data Analytics (STADIUS)](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) at the Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT).
I develop novel software and hardware edge AI and HPC technologies that enable realtime distributed sensing and continuous multimodal processing of sensor data for intelligent ambient healthcare applications.
Currently I'm heavily involved in the development of AI-enabled powered assisted mobility devices - lower-limb prostheses and exoskeletons, and wearable intervention devices for people with Parkinson's disease.

Prior to KU Leuven, I worked at the Nokia Bell Labs research centre in Antwerp, Belgium, where I co-patented a look-ahead computation hardware mechanism for efficient and energy-preserving AI computer architectures.

With domain expertise in digital circuits design, electronics, networks, distributed parallel software, and embedded systems, my focus is on delivering practical solutions, at the intersection of software and hardware, from the systems-level perspective to meet complex R&D challenges.

In the scarce free time outside of research, I like to throw myself out of planes, rip on my motorcycle, spend time outdoors, and dressmaking :3
